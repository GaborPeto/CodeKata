# CodeKata

 Let’s implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price
 of a number of items. In the supermarket, things are identified using
 individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually.
 In addition, some items are multipriced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y pence.
 For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 pence individually, but we have a special offer:
 buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £1.30. In fact this week’s prices are:

  Item    Unit      Special
          Price     Price
   --------------------------
     A     50       3 for 130
     B     30       2 for 45
     C     20
     D     15
